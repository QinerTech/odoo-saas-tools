             Odoo product model by it self has not ability to scale price different ways except of simple adding. 
             This module adds ability to scale product price by multiplying it. 
             For example if you need to sale some web service for hundred of user for two months you will be 
             forced to create different product positions for same item. But using this module you can just multiply price the way you want.
